            I started my journey with a Bachelor's in Psychology, fascinated by
            human behavior and the intricacies of the mind. While studying, I
            discovered my passion for problem-solving and analytical
            thinkingâ€”skills that are at the core of both psychology and
            technology.

            During my studies, I found myself drawn to the logical structure of
            coding and the endless possibilities it offers to create solutions
            that impact people's lives. I realized that just as psychology seeks
            to understand and improve human experiences, software engineering
            allows me to build tools and applications that solve real-world
            problems and enhance user experiences.

            transition={{ duration: 0.5, delay: 0.2 }}

            This realization led me to pivot towards coding, where I've since
            honed my skills in full-stack development and AI-driven
            technologies. My background in psychology gives me a unique
            perspective on user-centric design and empathy-driven development,
            ensuring that the applications I build are not only functional but
            also intuitive and impactful.

            Today, I'm a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence, combining
            my love for problem-solving with cutting-edge technology to create
            scalable, data-driven solutions. My journey from psychology to
            coding has taught me the value of adaptability, continuous learning,
            and the power of technology to transform ideas into reality.
